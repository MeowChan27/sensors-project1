About creating webpage using data collected with sensors. 

First need to run the Python main.py program to collect data from the sensors and insert them into the database(MySQL).
The database initialy contains a table atmosphere with 4 columns (time, temp, hum, pressure).

Then maybe need a Rest API to get data from the database to print them on the website...
